# Writeup

This challenge is the third "puppet" challenge relating to Uniswap Pools and is
very similar to Puppet V2, so I will not be covering those concepts but will be
focusing on the Uniswap V3 concepts. To catchup I reccomend watching my [YouTube
video on Puppet V2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9s8wWOP9LU) (at the start
of the video I also reccomend watching Puppet V1)
